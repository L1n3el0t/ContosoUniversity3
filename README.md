# ContosoUniversity3
I just realized after spending all day following your lecture 6 video that not everything aligned with the instructions, but if you look at the following programs in my next week submisssion (ContosoUniversity4) it should provide an export and use XDocument for the student database which was what this program did before I saw your video


1. Create an xml file of data from the students, courses, and instructors models
2. Create a class to seed the data and avoid duplicate runs
3. Run twice to make sure there are no duplicates
4. Delete a row from the database to test if deletion is successfull
